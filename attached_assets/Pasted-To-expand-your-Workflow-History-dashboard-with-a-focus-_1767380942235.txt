To expand your Workflow History dashboard with a focus on Docusign IAM’s unique capabilities—such as Maestro (orchestration), Navigator (AI-driven repository), and Identity Verification—here are five suggested workflows.These additions are designed to integrate the cross-functional teams you mentioned, like Partner Operations, Global Compliance, and GSOP.1. Partner Onboarding & KYC VerificationTeams Involved: Partner Operations, Global Compliance.IAM Mechanics: This workflow uses Docusign Maestro to first trigger a Web Form for data collection. It then inserts a mandatory Identity Verification (IDV) step, requiring the partner to upload a government-issued ID before the signature envelope is even generated.Outcome: Ensures that only verified "Authorized Users" (as defined in your IAM Service Schedule) can execute high-value partner agreements.2. Salesforce-Triggered Quote ExceptionTeams Involved: Sales Operations, GSOP.IAM Mechanics: An Upstream Integration starts this process when a "Non-Standard" flag is checked in Salesforce. Maestro’s Branch Logic routes the quote to Finance and Legal for approval only if it exceeds specific discount thresholds before automatically generating a signature-ready document.Outcome: Streamlines "Feature Count" monitoring by ensuring only approved exceptions consume specialized IAM features.3. FedRAMP-Compliant Procurement FlowTeams Involved: Global Compliance, Security and Privacy.IAM Mechanics: Specifically utilizes Docusign IAM Government Products. The workflow includes a "FedRAMP Boundary Check" to ensure that sensitive "Customer Data" exported via connectors to third-party tools remains compliant with FedRAMP Moderate authorized boundary requirements.Outcome: Maintains a rigorous audit trail of all data moving in and out of the "FedRAMP authorized boundary".4. Automated Renewal with Navigator InsightsTeams Involved: GSOP, Sales Operations.IAM Mechanics: This workflow is triggered by Docusign Navigator, which uses AI to scan the repository and identify contracts expiring in 90 days. Maestro then automatically prepares an "Amendment" or "Renewal" template, pre-populated with data extracted from the original "IAM Agreement".Outcome: Eliminates "The Agreement Trap" by transforming static data into proactive, signature-ready renewal actions.5. Cross-Functional Product Exception RequestTeams Involved: Product Exception Request, Security and Privacy, Legal.IAM Mechanics: A specialized workflow for tracking technical or security deviations. It uses Maestro to orchestrate sequential signatures from the CISO and Product Leads. The final signed exception is automatically "saved and stored" in Navigator with specific metadata tags for "Security Risk".Outcome: Provides a structured and searchable "Traceability Audit" for auditors and internal compliance reviews.Dashboard Update SummaryNew WorkflowPrimary IAM FeatureTeam LeadPartner KYC OnboardingID VerificationPartner OpsSales Quote ExceptionMaestro Branch LogicSales OpsGov ProcurementFedRAMP ConnectorComplianceAuto-RenewalNavigator AI SearchGSOPSecurity ExceptionMulti-Step OrchestrationSecurity
