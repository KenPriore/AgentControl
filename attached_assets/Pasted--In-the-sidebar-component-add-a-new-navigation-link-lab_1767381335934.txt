"In the sidebar component, add a new navigation link labeled 'Agent Monitor' directly below 'Workflow History'. Create a corresponding page that visualizes real-time AI agent performance. The page should include:A summary section for Autonomous Decisions and Human Handoffs.A data table showing 'Agent Name', 'Task', 'Data Sources Accessed', and 'Decision Logic'.A dedicated 'Exception & Oversight' feed highlighting cases where agents triggered a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) review due to policy or compliance conflicts."2. Proposed "Agent Monitor" Page ContentThis page provides transparency into how your agents are interacting with the Docusign IAM platform and where they are encountering friction that requires human intervention.A.

Oversight: Policy Exceptions for Human ReviewBased on the Docusign IAM Service Schedule, these represent critical points where an agent cannot make an autonomous decision:Instance 1: PII in Sandbox (Security & Privacy)Agent Logic: Sandbox Data Guard scanned a file in a demo account and detected Personally Identifiable Information9.Policy Conflict: The Service Schedule explicitly prohibits PII in Sandbox Accounts10.Action: Agent blocked the upload and created an exception for the Security and Privacy team11.Instance 2: FedRAMP Boundary Export (Compliance)Agent Logic: A workflow attempted to use a "Connector" to export data to a third-party service12.Policy Conflict: Customer authorizes Docusign to export data, but Docusign disclaims liability once data leaves the FedRAMP boundary131313.Action: Agent halted the export for a Global Compliance sign-off to acknowledge the boundary transition14.Instance 3: Feature Count Exceedance (Sales Operations)Agent Logic: A user attempted to activate a specific "Feature" not included in the current "Docusign IAM Plan"15.Policy Conflict: Exceeding the outlined Feature Count triggers additional per-feature overage fees16.Action: Agent triggered a "Product Exception Request" to Sales Ops before provisioning the feature17.
