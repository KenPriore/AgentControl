To update your dashboard using **Replit**, you can use the following prompt to modify your code and implement the new **Agent Monitor** view.

### 1. Replit Prompt

> "In the sidebar component, add a new navigation link labeled '**Agent Monitor**' directly below 'Workflow History'. Create a corresponding page that visualizes real-time AI agent performance. The page should include:
> 1. A summary section for **Autonomous Decisions** and **Human Handoffs**.
> 2. A data table showing 'Agent Name', 'Task', 'Data Sources Accessed', and 'Decision Logic'.
> 3. A dedicated 'Exception & Oversight' feed highlighting cases where agents triggered a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** review due to policy or compliance conflicts."
>

### 2. Proposed "Agent Monitor" Page Content

This page provides transparency into how your agents are interacting with the **Docusign IAM** platform and where they are encountering friction that requires human intervention.

#### **A. Agent Activity Overview**

* 
**Decision Distribution:** A chart comparing purely autonomous steps taken by **Docusign Maestro** against steps requiring manual approval.


* 
**Data Access Heatmap:** Visualizes which internal systems (Navigator, Salesforce, FedRAMP Boundary) are being queried most frequently.



#### **B. Agent Intelligence & Data Access Log**

This log tracks the specific logic applied to "IAM Agreements" and the connectors utilized.

| Agent Name | Current Task | Data Sources Accessed | Key Decision/Logic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Clause Architect** | NDA Redlining | MSA Playbook, Docusign Navigator 

 | Accepted standard Indemnity language; flagged custom Liability Cap. |
| **Policy Guardian** | Compliance Audit | FedRAMP Moderate Boundary 

 | Verified no sensitive Customer Data was exported to unapproved connectors.

 |
| **Risk Scout** | Overage Monitoring | IAM Order Form, Seat Allowance 

 | Identified 95% Seat utilization; alerted Sales Ops for potential overage.

#### **C. Oversight: Policy Exceptions for Human Review**

Based on the **Docusign IAM Service Schedule**, these represent critical points where an agent cannot make an autonomous decision:

* **Instance 1: PII in Sandbox (Security & Privacy)**
* 
**Agent Logic:** **Sandbox Data Guard** scanned a file in a demo account and detected Personally Identifiable Information.


* 
**Policy Conflict:** The Service Schedule explicitly prohibits PII in Sandbox Accounts.


* 
**Action:** Agent blocked the upload and created an exception for the **Security and Privacy** team.




* **Instance 2: FedRAMP Boundary Export (Compliance)**
* 
**Agent Logic:** A workflow attempted to use a "Connector" to export data to a third-party service.


* 
**Policy Conflict:** Customer authorizes Docusign to export data, but Docusign disclaims liability once data leaves the FedRAMP boundary.


* 
**Action:** Agent halted the export for a **Global Compliance** sign-off to acknowledge the boundary transition.




* **Instance 3: Feature Count Exceedance (Sales Operations)**
* 
**Agent Logic:** A user attempted to activate a specific "Feature" not included in the current "Docusign IAM Plan".


* 
**Policy Conflict:** Exceeding the outlined Feature Count triggers additional per-feature overage fees.


* 
**Action:** Agent triggered a "Product Exception Request" to **Sales Ops** before provisioning the feature.

Would you like me to **generate the JSON structure** for these exception logs so you can plug them directly into your Replit database?
